// Pure n8n supervision logic — no electron, no side effects.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// `electron-main.js` cannot be loaded outside Electron (`require('electron')`
// throws under plain node) and it exports nothing, so PATH construction,
// n8n resolution and the domain→env mapping had zero test coverage in the
// shipped 1.1.0 build. Everything here takes injected probes instead of
// touching the filesystem, so macOS-only paths stay verifiable on Linux.
//
// Rule for this repo: new platform-conditional or parsing logic goes in
// `lib/` with a test.
